## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### Which fact check outlets are indexed by this initiative?

Right now, just [Agência Lupa](http://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/), [Agência Pública](https://apublica.org/checagem/) and [Aos Fatos](https://aosfatos.org).

### How can my fact check outlet be indexed?

Send an email (the address is above) with the outlet link. We will index only reputable and/or trustworth outlets according to our editorial. An editorial guideline is on roadmap , but we don't know when it will be published.

In the technological side, we give priority to websites using WordPress and using the Fact Check schema in a LD+JSON markup. Our crawler and algorithms also prefer faster, accessible and secure (HTTPS) websites, specially those easily accessible by mobile phones and screenreaders.

Also, if you give express permission for our system to present content snippets from your website, the faster we will index your website and it will prioritized when presenting results.

As a rule of thumb, if it's good journalism and if is good for Google Page Speed Insights and pass the WCAG2.0 test, is good for us.

### Does this API drive traffic away from fact checking websites?

No! On the contrary, its goals is drive MORE traffic and/or increase reach for such websites.

### Does it hurt the SEO of those sites?

No. As an API, it just makes data accessible, but it does not count as content for search engines. And we have plans for a plugin allowing embedding and linking to fact check articles from other websites, which can drive more traffic and help with SEO.

###  Does this initiative have a commercial purpose?

No, this is a non-profit experiment. We want to make something bigger, but probably under a NGO or a Foundation like organization.
